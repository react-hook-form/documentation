          React Hook Form has support for native form validation, which lets you
          validate inputs with your own rules. Since most of us have to build
          forms with custom designs and layouts, it is our responsibility to
          make sure those are accessible (A11y).

        <p>
          The following code example works as intended for validation; however,
          it can be improved for accessibility.

          contain hundreds or thousands of rows, and each row will have inputs.
          A common practice is to only render the items that are in the
          viewport, however this will cause issues as the items are removed from
          the DOM when they are out of view, and re-added. This will cause items

        <p>
          In this example, there is a simple form without any apparent async
          code, and the test merely renders the component and tests for the
          presence of a button. However, it still logs the warning about updates
          not being wrapped in <code>act()</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is because react-hook-form internally uses asynchronous
          validation handlers. In order to compute the formState, it has to
          initially validate the form, which is done asynchronously, resulting
          in another render. That update happens after the test function
          returns, which triggers the warning.
        </p>

        <p>
          To solve this, wrap your <code>render()</code> calls in{" "}
          <code>await act(async () ={`> {}`})</code>:

          The native input returns the value in <code>string</code> format

          . However, it's not perfect, we still have to deal with{" "}
          <code>isNaN</code> or <code>null</code> values. So it's better to
          leave the transform at the custom hook level. In the following
          example, we are using the <code>Controller</code> to include the
          functionality of the transform value's input and output. You can also
          achieve a similar result with a custom <code>register</code>.
