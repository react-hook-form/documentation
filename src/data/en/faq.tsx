        <p>
          Performance is one of the primary reasons why this library was
          created. React Hook Form relies on uncontrolled components, which is
          the reason why the <code>register</code> function capture{" "}
          <code>ref</code>. This approach reduces the amount of re-rendering
          that occurs due to a user typing in an input or other form values
          changing. Components mount to the page faster than controlled
          components because they have less overhead. As a reference, there is a
          quick comparison test that you can refer to at{" "}

          <p>
            No, not out of the box. If you wanted to do this, you could build a
            wrapper around it and use it in your Class Component.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            You canâ€™t use Hooks inside of a class component, but you can
            definitely mix classes and function components with Hooks in a
            single tree. Whether a component is a class or a function that uses
            Hooks is an implementation detail of that component. In the longer
            term, we expect Hooks to be the primary way people write React
            components.

              <b>HTMLFormElement.reset()</b>

                This method does the same thing as clicking a form's reset

                React Hook Form API: <code>reset()</code>
              </b>
              <p>
                React Hook Form's <code>reset</code> method will reset all field
                values, and will also clear all <code>errors</code> within the
                form.

        <p>
          Being that React Hook Form relies on uncontrolled components, you can
          specify a <code>defaultValue</code> or <code>defaultChecked</code> to
          an individual field. However, it is more common to initialize a form
          by passing <code>defaultValues</code> to <code>useForm</code>.

      description: (
        <p>
          React Hook Form needs a <code>ref</code> to collect the input value,
          however, you may want to use <code>ref</code> for other purposes (e.g.
          scroll into the view, or focus).

          <p>
            You can actually <code>register</code> an input without a{" "}
            <code>ref</code>. In fact, you can manually <code>setValue</code>,{" "}
            <code>setError</code> and <code>trigger</code>.

          <p>
            <b className={typographyStyles.note}>Note:</b> Because{" "}
            <code>ref</code> has not been registered, React Hook Form won't be
            able to register event listeners to the inputs. This means you will

          <p>
            React Hook Form is based on uncontrolled inputs, which means you
            don't need to change the input <code>value</code> via{" "}
            <code>state</code> via <code>onChange</code>. This means you don't
            need <code>value</code> at all, and in fact, you only need to set{" "}

            is the reason why React wouldn't recognize the actual input that has
            been exchanged or swapped. As a solution, you can resolve this
            problem by giving a unique <code>key</code> prop to your input. You
            can also read more about the key props from{" "}

      title: "How to work with modal or tab forms?",

        <>
          <p>
            It's important to understand React Hook Form embraces native form
            behavior by storing input state inside each input (except custom{" "}
            <code>register</code> at <code>useEffect</code>). One of the common
            misconceptions is that when working with modal or tab forms, by
            mounting and unmounting form/inputs that inputs state will remain.
            That is incorrect. Instead, the correct solution would be to build a
            new form for your form inside each modal or tab and capture your
            submission data in local or global state and then do something with
            the combined data.

      title: "Controller not working with shouldFocusError?",
      description: (
        <>
          <p>
            After a validation error, React Hook Form will automatically focus
            the invalids elements that have a proper ref, like the native inputs
            (eg: <code>{`<input />`}</code>) or some 3rd party Components that
            correctly export a ref (eg: from MUI{" "}
            <code>{`<TextField inputRef={register({required: 'Field Required'})} />`}</code>
            )
          </p>

          <p>
            However, for some 3rd party controlled Components (like{" "}
            <code>{`<Autocomplete>`}</code> from MUI or <code>{`<XX>`}</code>{" "}
            from AntD) it's very difficult to predict its ref because the
            formats vary. In this case, React Hook Form will properly detect the
            validation error but <i>will not be able to</i> automatically focus
            that kind of Component.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a workaround, after the validation error, you can manually focus
            the 3rd party controlled Component (if you can get the actual
            internal input ref), for example:
          </p>
          <CodeArea rawData={focusController} />

          <p>
            If you find difficult to make the autofocus with external controlled
            component work correctly, it is possible to disable the "autofocus
            on error" feature. It is possible that this behavior will bring a
            better user experience in some cases.{" "}
            <code>{`useForm({shouldFocusError: false});`}</code>

            Short answer: <b>Yes</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>react-hook-form</code> is not recommending you to build
            controlled forms, however you can still achieve that easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trick is to use the <code>watch</code> API to monitor each
            input's change and assign it to the value prop.
          </p>

              </p>

              <p>
                React Hook Form doesn't register inputs during server side
                render, which means testing in react native could result in the{" "}
                <code>window</code> object being <code>undefined</code>. A quick
                fix would be to stub the <code>window</code> object to enable
                the registration process.

              </p>

              <p>
                All validation methods in React Hook Form will be treated as
                async functions, so it's important to wrap <code>async</code>{" "}

              <p>
                React Hook Form uses <code>input</code> events for input
