      title: "Performance of React Hook Form",
      description: (
        <p>
          Performance is one of the primary reasons why this library was
          created. React Hook Form relies on an uncontrolled form, which is the
          reason why the <code>register</code> function captures{" "}
          <code>ref</code> and the controlled component has its re-rendering
          scope with <code>Controller</code> or <code>useController</code>. This
          approach reduces the amount of re-rendering that occurs due to a user
          typing in an input or other form values changing at the root of your
          form or applications. Components mount to the page faster than
          controlled components because they have less overhead. As a reference,
          there is a quick comparison test that you can refer to at{" "}

          <p>
            No, not out of the box. If you want to do this, you can build a
            wrapper around it and use it in your Class Component.
          </p>

          <blockquote>
            You canâ€™t use Hooks inside of a class component, but you can
            definitely mix classes and function components with Hooks in a
            single tree. Whether a component is a class or a function that uses
            Hooks is simply an implementation detail of that component. In the
            longer term, we expect Hooks to be the primary way people write
            React components.

              <b>HTMLFormElement.reset()</b>
              <p>
                This method does the same thing as clicking a form's reset
                button. It only clears <code>input/select/checkbox</code>{" "}
                values.

      description: (

          <p>
            Being that React Hook Form relies on an uncontrolled form, you can
            specify a <code>defaultValue</code> or <code>defaultChecked</code>{" "}
            to an individual field. However, it is more common and recommended
            to initialize a form by passing <code>defaultValues</code> to{" "}
            <code>useForm</code>.

      description: (
        <>
          <p>
            React Hook Form needs a <code>ref</code> to collect the input value.
            However, you may want to use <code>ref</code> for other purposes
            (e.g. scroll into the view, or focus).

      title: "What if you don't have access to ref?",
      description: (
        <>
          <p>
            You can actually <code>register</code> an input without a{" "}
            <code>ref</code>. In fact, you can manually <code>setValue</code>,{" "}
            <code>setError</code> and <code>trigger</code>.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b className={typographyStyles.note}>Note:</b> Because{" "}
            <code>ref</code> has not been registered, React Hook Form won't be
            able to register event listeners to the inputs. This means you will
            have to manually update value and error.

          <p>
            React Hook Form is focusing on uncontrolled inputs, which means you
            don't need to change the input <code>value</code> via{" "}
            <code>state</code> via <code>onChange</code>. In fact, you don't
            need <code>value</code> at all. You only need to set{" "}

            React Hook Form doesn't control your entire form and inputs, which
            is why React wouldn't recognize that the actual input has been
            exchanged or swapped. As a solution, you can resolve this problem by
            giving a unique <code>key</code> prop to your input. You can also
            read more about the key props from{" "}

      description: (
        <>
          <p>
            It's important to understand that React Hook Form embraces native
            form behavior by storing input state inside each input (except
            custom <code>register</code> at <code>useEffect</code>). A common
            misconception is that input state remains with mounted or unmounted
            inputs. Such as when working with a modal or tab forms. Instead, the
            correct solution is to build a new form for your form inside each
            modal or tab and capture your submission data in local or global
            state and then do something with the combined data.

          <p>
            After a validation error, React Hook Form will automatically focus
            the invalids elements that have a proper ref, like the native inputs
            (eg: <code>{`<input />`}</code>) or some 3rd party Components that
            correctly export a ref (eg: from MUI{" "}
            <code>{`<TextField inputRef={register({required: 'Field Required'})} />`}</code>
            )
          </p>

          <p>
            However, for some 3rd party controlled Components (like{" "}
            <code>{`<Autocomplete>`}</code> from MUI or <code>{`<XX>`}</code>{" "}
            from AntD) it's very difficult to predict its ref because the
            formats vary. In this case, React Hook Form will properly detect the
            validation error but <i>will not be able to</i> automatically focus
            that kind of Component.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a workaround, after the validation error, you can manually focus
            the 3rd party controlled Component (if you can get the actual
            internal input ref), for example:
          </p>
          <CodeArea rawData={focusController} />

          <p>
            If you find difficult to make the autofocus with external controlled
            component work correctly, it is possible to disable the "autofocus
            on error" feature. It is possible that this behavior will bring a
            better user experience in some cases.{" "}

            Short answer: <b>Yes</b>
          </p>
          <p>
            <code>react-hook-form</code> is not recommending you to build
            controlled forms, however you can still achieve that easily.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trick is to use the <code>watch</code> API to monitor each
            input's change and assign it to the value prop.
          </p>

              </p>

              <p>
                React Hook Form doesn't register inputs during server side
                render, which means testing in react native could result in the{" "}
                <code>window</code> object being <code>undefined</code>. A quick
                fix would be to stub the <code>window</code> object to enable
                the registration process.

                All validation methods in React Hook Form will be treated as
                async functions, so it's important to wrap <code>async</code>{" "}
